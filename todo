What needs to be added:
- logging
- translation
- duplication verification
    - tracker must keep the events
    - need to adjust tracking
- add transformation abstraction
- add locator so we can choose proper writer based on the provided command option
- write tests
    - unit tests?
    - integration tests?
    - https://symfony.com/doc/current/testing.html
- perhaps the basic model should be called `Message` and should be initialized via serializer? [done]
- enhancing tracking for unprocessed records
    - we should keep the message number + explanation why it was found faulty
